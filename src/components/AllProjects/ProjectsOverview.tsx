                        I personally worked on designing the final boss, as well as programming and implementing two enemy behaviors and the boss's two ranged attacks. `

                        I also designed and programmed the Grand Piano final boss. This final boss was personally one of my favorite parts of my projects, as it was a challenge to balance both creating this boss and cramming for finals at the same time.

                        You can skip ahead to access to the boss by using the shortcut: Shift+Alt+B.`

                        I worked in a team of 10 writers, programmers, designers, and an artist. I designed the combat system, and created and balanced all abilities for every character and enemy.

                        One of my favorite abilities I created was the Statistician's "Deletion". The original design was to set a random stat from the targeted enemy to 0, but when it was implemented into the game it ended up being able to set both the target's name and HP to 0 as well. We all got a good laugh out of it, and felt that it fit the theme of Acid Trip well, so we kept it in the game. 

                        I also made three character portraits for the main characters of the game! These were used for the visual novel portion of the game.`

                        This was created as a final project for a course on data analytics in games, and aimed to answer research questions regarding the game as its season came to an end. Creating the data pipeline for this project was something I had never done before, but I found the data extraction and analysis processes to be extremely interesting. Although the Riot Games API provides limited game data for Teamfight Tactics compared to their other titles, my partner and I were able to produce significant results.`
