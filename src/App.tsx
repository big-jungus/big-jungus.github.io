My main focus for this game was on the game's task system for both classes and projects, as well as features surrounding them.

        Part of the challenge of designing this game's UI came from the game's limited pixel size. Because I had limited space to work with, I had to design a UI that would keep the focus on the core gameplay while still displaying all relevant information for players.`

                        I worked in a team of 10 writers, programmers, designers, and an artist. I designed the combat system, and created and balanced all abilities for every character and enemy.

                        One of my favorite abilities I created was the Statistician's "Deletion". The original design was to set a random stat from the targeted enemy to 0, but when it was implemented into the game it ended up being able to set both the target's name and HP to 0 as well. We all got a good laugh out of it, and felt that it fit the theme of Acid Trip well, so we kept it in the game. 

                        I also made three character portraits for the main characters of the game! These were used for the visual novel portion of the game.`

Although the Riot Games API provides limited game data for Teamfight Tactics compared to their other titles, my partner and I were able to produce significant results.`
