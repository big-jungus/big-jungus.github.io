We are working alongside other students from the Laguna College of Art and Design to create the game's art as well! The game is currently in progress, and aims to be finished by March 2024.
        
        I personally handle UI programming for this project, as well as general gameplay programming. On the UI end, I work with UI designers to properly implement their designs from Figma into the game. I handle both the implementation of designs into Unreal's UMG system to create widgets, as well as the functionality for connecting relevant information to these widgets. I also implemented the entire settings menu for the game, with features like key remapping, graphics changes, and colorblind support!. On the gameplay programming end, I also work with other gameplay programmers and designers to implement various gameplay features.
        
        One of my favorite things I've created so far for this project is the Investigation system. Upon using Ether, players are able to see various interactable objects highlighted in the world using post-processing. I worked with the person who implemented this to add an additional feature, where aiming at that object would pull up relevant information to it, such as a guard's state, path, etc.`

This game is currently in progress still, and aims to be finish production by the end of March 2024!
        
        I personally work on programming enemies for this game, and have implemented each of the game's bosses. Much of the game's combat system is built around large networks of delegates, and I personally enjoy the problem-solving involved in figuring out ways to implement unique behaviors for each boss while still adhering the existing combat system.
        
        One of my favorite bosses to implement was the Sweet Boss, as one of its unique moves redistributed damage dealt to all of its allies during the turn. Figuring out how to properly implement this design was challenging, but extremely satisfying to finally complete.`

                        One of my favorite abilities I created was the Statistician's "Deletion". The original design was to set a random stat from the targeted enemy to 0, but when it was implemented into the game it ended up being able to set both the target's name and HP to 0 as well. We all got a good laugh out of it, and felt that it fit the theme of Acid Trip well, so we kept it in the game. 

                        I also made three character portraits for the main characters of the game! These were used for the visual novel portion of the game.`
