# My Portfolio
Hi! If you're currently reading this, this is the repository for my website. 

This web-app was created using React & Vite, all of which I challenged myself to learn within two weeks. I was able to create the core of my site and have it hosted on Github Pages by this deadline, and have now moved it to be hosted on a separate domain: matthew-jung.com
