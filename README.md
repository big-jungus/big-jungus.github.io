# My Portfolio
Hi! If you're currently reading this, this is the repository for my website. 

This web-app was created using React & Vite, all of which I challenged myself to learn within two weeks. I was able to create the core of my site and have it hosted on Github Pages by this deadline, and I spent a couple extra days to ensure that it would be a viewable experience from various platforms.
